  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/animations/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  fonts:
    - family: Nexa
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/NexaLight.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/NexaBold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa_Heavy.ttf
          weight: 800
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
